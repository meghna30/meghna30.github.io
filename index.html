                <p> I am a Doctoral Student in the <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/" target="_blank">CIS</a> department at the University of Pennsylvania and a memeber of the <a href="https://lifelongml.seas.upenn.edu/" target="_blank">Lifelong Machine Learning Group</a> in the GRASP Lab advised by <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~eeaton/" target="_blank">Prof Eric Eaton</a>. My research interests lie in exploring how can we enable AI agents to continually learn and grow through reasoning and exploration. My recent focus has been to learn and exploit representations that enable AI agents to both detect novelty or uncertainty and accommodate it in a seamless fashion, thereby creating learning frameworks that can continually learn throughout their lifetime rendering them safe and reliable for deployment in the real world.</p>
                <p>I received my MS in robotics from the University of Pennsylvania and my BS in Electrical Engineering from PES Institute of Technology.</p>

                  <!-- I am currently a PhD student in the <a href="https://www.me.upenn.edu/" target="_blank">MEAM</a> department at Penn and a member of the <a href="https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/" target="_blank">GRASP Lab</a> advised by <a href="https://www.kumarrobotics.org/" target="_blank">Prof. Vijay Kumar</a>. I'm excited about planning for mobile robots and wireless communication. Recently, I've been investigating how to enable teams of robots to effectively accomplish their goals while honoring communication contraints. In 2019 I was awarded a <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/" target="_blank">NSF graduate research fellowship</a>. Previously, I completed BS and MS degrees in Mechanical Engineering at <a href="https://drexel.edu/" target="_blank">Drexel University</a> where I worked in the <a href="https://scalar.seas.upenn.edu/" target="_blank">ScalAR Lab</a> with Prof. Ani Hsieh.</p> -->
